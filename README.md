  IDEAS
  Add hyperlinks to noted standards
  Option for user to save a member in a dropdown that will automatically populate fields with saved values
    Very unsure of how to go about this, probably involves local memory, cookies, etc.

  TO-DO
  Make inputs update on text field change
  Combine ALL text in python and pass to html except for head of html (Everything down to line 130)
