AESTHETIC QUESTIONS/TOPICS

- TITLE
- coloring?
- make footer appear at bottom of page?
- make .button look better (looks funky because I was figuring out how to style them)

NOTES FOR DR. DENAVIT:

- Line 115, 116, 151, 162, 169: the unit of "threads" should technically be unitless, correct? Should a note be made that "threads" is unitless to explain where it disappears in the derivations?
- Line 144: should it be psi or lbs/in^2
- Line 150: I want to strikethrough the LE on line 151 to show they cancel. The "cancel" package seems like it would work, but I am not sure how to implement it. Here are a couple links to check: [1](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/395677/cancel-package-documentation-shaded-blocks-to-cancel), [2](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/537955/how-do-cross-out-text-in-math-mode)
- Line 150, 151: Should lines 150 and 151 be in the same line like lines 161 and 168?
- Line 152: should this intermediate step be added? it is a simplification of the equation in line 151 and I feel it better shows how units cancel
- Line 162, 169: I feel kinda stupid, but how does the length of engagement work units wise? Currently it would make calculations in.^3 in lines like 162 and 169
- Line 163: The equation for LE used is 2(As1a) / ASn2a, LEr_15 is 2(As1a) / ASs4b. Did I do something wrong when reading the equations from the FED-STD document?
- Line 163, 171: Why do some of the LEs appear unitless while one has units of inches
