AESTHETIC QUESTIONS/TOPICS

- TITLE
- coloring?
- make footer appear at bottom of page?
- make .button look better (looks funky because I was figuring out how to style them)

NOTES FOR DR. DENAVIT:

- Please double check the calculations. I had to redo a lot of them due to some errors in the code. I believe they are all correct but I want a second set of eyes to be sure.
- Same thing goes for the units

- Line 144: should it be psi or lbs/in^2
- Line 149-153: Should these all be in one line or split up as they are now?
- Line 152, 154: should this intermediate step be added? it is a simplification of the equation in line 151 and I feel it better shows how units cancel
