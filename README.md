IDEAS
Add hyperlinks to noted standards
Option for user to save a member in a dropdown that will automatically populate fields with saved values
Very unsure of how to go about this, probably involves local memory, cookies, etc.

TO-DO
Make inputs update on text field change **or** add calculate button
Make last selected member clear on page close
fix col-# in css to be sequential
add bolt @app.route
add nav bar at top with home button and other calculators????
edit .button in css to be more visually appealing

NOTES

Create class to build HTML output.

html_str = html_str_generator(indent=6)
html_str.append('heading','h1')
html_str.append('text','p')
html_str.append(r'$P_n = F_y A_g$','p')
html_str.append_part('partial line of text')
