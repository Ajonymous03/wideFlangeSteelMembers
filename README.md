AESTHETIC QUESTIONS/TOPICS

- TITLE
- coloring?
- make footer appear at bottom of page?
- make .button look better (looks funky because I was figuring out how to style them)

NOTES FOR DR. DENAVIT:

- Please double check the calculations. I had to redo a lot of them due to some errors in the code. I believe they are all correct but I want a second set of eyes to be sure.
- Same thing goes for the units

- Line 115, 116, 151, 162, 169: the unit of "threads" should technically be unitless, correct? Should a note be made that "threads" is unitless to explain where it disappears in the derivations?
- Line 144: should it be psi or lbs/in^2
- Line 149-153: Should these all be in one line or split up as they are now?
- Line 152: should this intermediate step be added? it is a simplification of the equation in line 151 and I feel it better shows how units cancel
- Line 163: The equation for LE used is 2(As1a) / ASn2a, LEr_15 is 2(As1a) / ASs4a. Did I do something wrong when reading the equations from the FED-STD document?
- Line 163, 171: Why do some of the LEs appear unitless while one has units of inches
