  IDEAS
  Add hyperlinks to noted standards
  Option for user to save a member in a dropdown that will automatically populate fields with saved values
    Very unsure of how to go about this, probably involves local memory, cookies, etc.

  TO-DO
  Make inputs update on text field change
    **Attempted to just check for a change and then submit the form but it did not submit. Unsure why it would not submit.**
  
  Create class to build HTML output.
  
  html_str = html_str_generator(indent=6)
  html_str.append('heading','h1')
  html_str.append('text','p')
  html_str.append(r'$P_n = F_y A_g$','p')
  html_str.append_part('partial line of text')
