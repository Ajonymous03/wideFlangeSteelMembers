  IDEAS
  Add hyperlinks to noted standards
  Option for user to save a member in a dropdown that will automatically populate fields with saved values
    Very unsure of how to go about this, probably involves local memory, cookies, etc.

  TO-DO
  Make inputs update on text field change
    **Attempted to just check for a change and then submit the form but it did not submit. Unsure why it would not submit.**
