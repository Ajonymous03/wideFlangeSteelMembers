AESTHETIC QUESTIONS/TOPICS

- coloring?
- branding, such as UT logos/coloring and such (I assume no)
    - site title/name
- make .button look better (looks funky because I was figuring out how to style them)
- align inputs and buttons on fed std page.

  - potentially same for wide flange page?

- LE
  - added LE to ASsmax and ASnmin, shows that it cancels out
- make end result more obvious
  - bold it? Box it? some combination of things?
    -bold a few words then a few words to highlight specific sections
- width
  - limited width to 1200px and centered it
- aligning inputs and indenting equations needs some time to look into it
- home button will be done hopefully tonight
